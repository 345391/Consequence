*Adjective for a man and man’s name* 

met 

**Crazy Katie** 

He wore a *what he wore* 

She wore a **Plaid t-shirt with as many coffee stains on as piercings in her ears and jeans so tight it would make feminists scream "Patriarchy" **

He said *“what he said"*

She said **“What if I told you this story was created by one man on a computer using a text editor only for class and we are only just figures of someones imagination just for the pure pleasure of having a fantasy world and we cant control our own lifes. Welcome to Crazy Conspiracy Theories”**

As a consequence, *the consequence*.

And the world said **“Fuck this shit I'm out”**
